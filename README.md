# RNN-Keras: Text Classification and Machine Translation

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** using **Keras** for tasks such as text classification
 and machine translation. RNNs are powerful deep learning models designed to handle sequential data like text, audio, video, and time series.

## Introduction
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network specifically designed to process sequences. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs maintain a hidden state that allows them to "remember" information from previous timesteps. This makes them ideal for:

- Text Classification: Categorizing input text into predefined classes.
- Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.

## Key Features
1. **Sequential Data Processing:** RNNs process data one timestep at a time, maintaining awareness of prior context.
2. **Text Classification:** Implementation of a model to classify input text into categories.
3. **Machine Translation:** Implementation of a sequence-to-sequence model for language translation.

## Getting Started

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
RNN-Keras-Text-Classification-and-MT/
|—— data/               # Contains datasets for text classification and machine translation
|—— notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for implementation
|     |—— text_classification.ipynb  # Notebook for text classification using RNNs
|     |—— machine_translation.ipynb   # Notebook for machine translation
|—— models/             # Saved models and checkpoints
|—— utils/              # Utility scripts (e.g., preprocessing, evaluation)
|—— README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Place your datasets in the `data/` directory.
   - Run preprocessing scripts (if required) located in the `utils/` folder.

2. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
   - Execute cells step-by-step to train the models and visualize results.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/text_classification.ipynb
   jupyter notebook notebooks/machine_translation.ipynb
   ```

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Follow the instructions in the notebooks to train the models and evaluate their performance.

## Results
- **Text Classification**: The model achieves high accuracy on the provided dataset, demonstrating its ability to categorize text into appropriate classes.
- **Machine Translation**: The sequence-to-sequence RNN model successfully translates input sentences from the source language to the target language.
